import all customer data from the FARMER group, rename this Farmer group to "suppliers"
import all catalog categories
import all catalog including categories
setup the credit module
create the supplier customer frontend "dashboard" (or profile) page (where they can request credit budget, see order status, see hidden catalog inventory, etc like now).
don't setup the "theme/style" we do this later.
don't install additional paymethods (we don't need them, we only use the credit point method)
don't install any additional delivery (we don't need them, we deliver from our own warehouse).
don't install the multiware house.
investigate time needed to install this module https://rentalbookingsoftware.com/
import old catalog all languges
in new shop maintain NL, DE, FR and EN language

	Admin Image Manager
	- Admin would like to have an image management dashboard [as they sometimes
	may be uploading thousands of images per time] that allows them to simply add and
	remove images.
	- Once images are uploaded, we would like to have a script that automatically
	categorises the tags for the image [Please take a look at Tensor Flow Image
	recognition]
	- Water Mark Images across site and protect
	For example:
	We upload an image of a woman in a black dress and the website then populates the 
	tags for the image that are relevant, e.g in this caseâ€¦
	woman, dress, black dress, female, clothes etc etc.
	- Only admin will have the ability to upload photos to this website, we would not
	like to have a contributor function like alamy.com
